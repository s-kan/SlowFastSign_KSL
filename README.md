Fig. 1. Overall Architecture. Our framework extracts spatial and dynamic features in parallel using the Slow and Fast pathways. Bi-directional Feature Fusion (BFF) facilitates the exchange of rich information between two pathways. Pathway Feature Enhancement (PFE) amplifies the sequence feature of each pathway by utilising characteristics sourced from different sample rates.

<br /> <br />
The objective of this work is the effective extraction of spatial and dynamic features for Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR). To accomplish this, we utilise a two-pathway SlowFast network, where each pathway operates at distinct temporal resolutions to separately capture spatial (hand shapes, facial expressions) and dynamic (movements) information. In addition, we introduce two distinct feature fusion methods, carefully designed for the characteristics of CSLR: (1) Bi-directional Feature Fusion (BFF), which facilitates the transfer of dynamic semantics into spatial semantics and vice versa; and (2) Pathway Feature Enhancement (PFE), which enriches dynamic and spatial representations through auxiliary subnetworks, while avoiding the need for extra inference time. As a result, our model further strengthens spatial and dynamic representations in parallel. We demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art performance on popular CSLR datasets, including PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, and CSL-Daily.

## Prerequisites
- Python == 3.8
- PyTorch == 1.13
- ctcdecode == 1.0.3 [[parlance/ctcdecode]](https://github.com/parlance/ctcdecode)，for beam search decode.
- You can install other required modules by running  
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Data Preparation
Please follow the instruction in [CorrNet](https://github.com/hulianyuyy/CorrNet) github repo to download and preprocess the datasets (PHOENIX2014, PHOENIX2014-T, CSL-Daily).
The structure of dataset directory is as follows (There may be other additional directories.):
```
dataset
├── phoenix2014
│   └── phoenix-2014-multisigner
│       └── features
│           └── fullFrame-256x256px
├── phoenix2014-T
│   └── features
│       └── fullFrame-256x256px
└── CSL-Daily
    └── sentence
        └── frames_256x256
```

## Inference
Pretrained models can be downloaded from [[Google Drive]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_gn6g4ZsjzKuhptdzHmDqKoFc3zIYpVf?usp=sharing).
| Dataset       | Dev WER (%) | Test WER (%) |
|:--------------| :-----: | :------: |
| PHOENIX2014   | 18.01 | 18.28 |
| PHOENIX2014-T | 17.66 | 18.71 |
| CSL-Daily     | 25.49 | 24.85 |

To evaluate the pretrained model, run the command below:
```bash
python main.py --device 0 --dataset phoenix2014 --phase test --load-weights ./best_checkpoints/phoenix2014_dev_18.01_test_18.28.pt --work-dir ./work_dir/phoenix2014_test/
```

## Training 
Before you start training, download the pre-trained SlowFast pkl file by running the following code:
```bash
mkdir ckpt && cd ckpt
wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/pyslowfast/model_zoo/ava/pretrain/SLOWFAST_64x2_R101_50_50.pkl
```

To train the SlowFastSign model, run the command below:
```bash
python main.py --device 0 --dataset KSL --loss-weights Slow=0.25 Fast=0.25 --work-dir ./work_dir/KSL/
```
You can check other arguments for training from `utils/parameters.py`
